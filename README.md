## Technology Stack

### Headless CMS  
We used **Sanity.io** as our Headless CMS backend. Sanity provides a flexible content studio for managing review data and exposes a REST API that our frontend consumes to fetch review content dynamically.

### Frontend  
The frontend is built with **Vue 3** using the **Vue Router** for navigation. The UI components and styling are based on **Element Plus** UI framework, ensuring a modern and responsive design optimized for various screen sizes.

## Features
- Displays a list of video game reviews  
- Search functionality to filter games by title  
- Detailed review pages with game info (genre, platform, rating, summary, content)  
- Responsive navigation with Home and Search pages  
- Clean, attractive UI with Element Plus components  

## Deployment
- Backend (Sanity CMS): Hosted on Sanity’s cloud platform  
- Frontend: Published on Netlify and publicly accessible  

## How to Run Locally
1. Clone the frontend repo  
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies  
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the frontend locally  
4. Backend is managed through Sanity’s hosted environment
